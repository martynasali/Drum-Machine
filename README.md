#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/qsbGzSu8HJU
#### Description:
This is an application of Drum Machine, with which you can make drum patters. You can make patterns with four sounds and every sound has 16 positions, there is adjustment of tempo and octave. All sounds are generated by javascript digital oscillator, by help of library called Tone.js, which has confusing documentation. For visual side I used react and taillwind and material ui for styling.

Main file is Player.js it has synth parameters and synths themselves, button components, play and stop logic, styling. 
App.js is linked to tailwind library and to Player.js
